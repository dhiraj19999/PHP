Lexical str in php=  the set of rules that govern how to write programs in that language
php is an whitespace insensitive
in php kewords like echo, print , for , if, while, class are not case sensititve means we can write Eacho and eacho are same but varibles are case sensititve
Rules for PHP variables:

A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)
we can't do like First-name but we can do First_Name
A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. The value cannot be changed during the script.
In PHP, var_dump() is a very useful function for debugging because it provides detailed information about a variable, including its type and value and size. It works for all types of variables, 
including arrays and objects.
