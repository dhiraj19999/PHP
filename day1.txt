The term PHP is an acronym for – Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is an open-source which means it is free to 
download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The file extension of PHP is “.php”.

What is PHP?
PHP is a server-side scripting language created primarily for web development but it is also used as a general-purpose programming language. Unlike client-side languages like JavaScript, 
which are executed on the user’s browser, PHP scripts run on the server. The results are then sent to the client’s web browser as plain HTML.

History of PHP
PHP was introduced by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the first version and participated in the later versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler. The language quickly
 evolved and was given the name “PHP,” which initially named was “Personal Home Page.”

PHP 3 (1998): The first version considered suitable for widespread use.
PHP 4 (2000): Improved performance and the introduction of the Zend Engine.
PHP 5 (2004): Added object-oriented programming features.
PHP 7 (2015): Significant performance improvements and reduced memory usage.
PHP 8 (2020): Introduction of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, further enhancing performance.
Characteristics of PHP
PHP code is executed in the server.
It can be integrated with many databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, and Informix.
It is powerful to hold a content management system like WordPress and can be used to control user access.
It supports main protocols like HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, IMAP, FTP, and others.
Websites like www.facebook.com and www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.
One of the main reasons behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file.
The thing that differentiates PHP from the client-side language like HTML is, that PHP codes are executed on the server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are
 first executed on the server and then the result is returned to the browser.
The only information that the client or browser knows is the result returned after executing the PHP script on the server and not the actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files 
can support other client-side scripting languages like CSS and JavaScript.
How PHP Works?
PHP scripts are executed on the server. Here’s a typical flow of how PHP works:

A user requests a PHP page via their web browser.
The server processes the PHP code. The PHP interpreter parses the script, executes the code, and generates HTML output.
The server sends the generated HTML back to the client’s browser, which renders the web page.
This server-side processing allows for dynamic content generation and ensures that sensitive code is not exposed to the client.


Features of PHP
Dynamic Typing: PHP is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly.
Cross-Platform: PHP runs on various platforms, making it compatible with different operating systems.
Database Integration: PHP provides built-in support for interacting with databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others.
Server-Side Scripting: PHP scripts are executed on the server, generating HTML that is sent to the client’s browser.
Applications of PHP
PHP is versatile and can be used in a variety of web development scenarios, including:

Dynamic Web Pages: Generating dynamic content based on user interaction or other conditions.
Content Management Systems (CMS): Many popular CMSs like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal are built with PHP.
E-commerce Platforms: PHP is commonly used to develop e-commerce websites due to its database integration capabilities.
Web Applications: PHP is used for creating feature-rich web applications such as social media platforms, forums, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
API Development: PHP can be used to create APIs for web and mobile applications.
Why should we use PHP?
PHP can actually do anything related to server-side scripting or more popularly known as the backend of a website. For example, PHP can receive data from forms, generate dynamic page content, can work with databases, create sessions, send and receive cookies, send emails, etc. There are also many hash functions available in PHP to encrypt users’ data which makes PHP secure and reliable to be used as a server-side scripting language. So these are some of PHP’s abilities that make it suitable to be used as a server-side scripting language. You will get to know more of these abilities in further tutorials. 
Even if the above abilities do not convince you of PHP, there are some more features of PHP. PHP can run on all major operating systems like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc. Almost all of the major servers available today like Apache supports PHP. PHP allows using a wide range of databases. And the most important factor is that it is free to use and download and anyone can download PHP from its official source: www.php.net.

Lexical str in php=  the set of rules that govern how to write programs in that language
php is an whitespace insensitive
in php kewords like echo, print , for , if, while, class are not case sensititve means we can write Eacho and eacho are same but varibles are case sensititve
Rules for PHP variables:

A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)
we can't do like First-name but we can do First_Name
A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. The value cannot be changed during the script.
In PHP, var_dump() is a very useful function for debugging because it provides detailed information about a variable, including its type and value and size. It works for all types of variables, 
including arrays and objects.
echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.
echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print
define( ) and const Keywords are used to define constants
  define(name,Value,case-insensitive)
  define fun case-insensitive by nature 
  define(name,value,true)
   define()                              	const keyword
Defines constants at runtime	           Defines class constants at compile time
Can be defined anywhere in the script	   Can only be defined within classes or interfaces
Case-insensitive by default               	Case-sensitive by default


The constant() function returns the value of a constant.
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
The PHP arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common arithmetical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication etc



PHP Assignment Operators
The PHP assignment operators are used with numeric values to write a value to a variable.

The basic assignment operator in PHP is "=". It means that the left operand gets set to the value of the assignment expression on the right.

Assignment	          Same as...	           Description	
x = y	              x = y	                 The left operand gets set to the value of the expression on the right	
x += y	             x = x + y	               Addition	
x -= y	              x = x - y	               Subtraction	
x *= y	            x = x * y	               Multiplication	
x /= y	            x = x / y	                 Division	
x %= y	            x = x % y	                 Modulus




PHP Comparison Operators
The PHP comparison operators are used to compare two values (number or string):

Operator	Name	            Example	                                Result	
==	       Equal	              $x == $y	                         Returns true if $x is equal to $y	
===    	Identical	          $x === $y	                    Returns true if $x is equal to $y, and they are of the same type	
!=	   Not equal	         $x != $y	                     Returns true if $x is not equal to $y	
<>	   Not equal	            $x <> $y	                      Returns true if $x is not equal to $y	
!==	   Not identical	      $x !== $y	                 Returns true if $x is not equal to $y, or they are not of the same type	
>	   Greater than	           $x > $y	                   Returns true if $x is greater than $y	
<	   Less than	            $x < $y	                      Returns true if $x is less than $y	
>=	   Greater than or equal to	$x >= $y	  Returns true if $x is greater than or equal to $y	
<=	   Less than or equal to	 $x <= $y	     Returns true if $x is less than or equal to $y	
<=>	   Spaceship	           $x <=> $y	            Returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero, depending on if $x is less than, equal to, or greater than $y. Introduced in PHP 7.







PHP Increment / Decrement Operators

The PHP increment operators are used to increment a variable's value.

The PHP decrement operators are used to decrement a variable's value.

Operator	   Same as...	          Description	
++$x	      Pre-increment	          Increments $x by one, then returns $x	
$x++	     Post-increment         	Returns $x, then increments $x by one	
--$x	    Pre-decrement	        Decrements $x by one, then returns $x	
$x--	   Post-decrement	       Returns $x, then decrements $x by one	
PHP     Logical Operators
T

The PHP logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.
 
Operator	Name	      Example	     Result	
and    	And	             $x and $y	                 True if both $x and $y are true	
or	    Or	             $x or $y	                True if either $x or $y is true	
xor	    Xor	               $x xor $y	                True if either $x or $y is true, but not both	
&&	    And	             $x && $y	                True if both $x and $y are true	
||	     Or	            $x || $y	                True if either $x or $y is true	
!	      Not	               !$x	                  True  if $x is not true	


PHP String Operators
PHP has two operators that are specially designed for strings.

Operator	    Name	                    Example	                                 Result	
.	           Concatenation	          $txt1 . $txt2	              Concatenation of $txt1 and $txt2	
.=	        Concatenation assignment	$txt1 .= $txt2	          Appends $txt2 to $txt1	



PHP Array Operators
The PHP array operators are used to compare arrays.

Operator	Name	             Example	                             Result	
+	       Union	               $x + $y	                        Union of $x and $y	
==	    Equality	         $x == $y	                   Returns true if $x and $y have the same key/value pairs	
===	   Identity	         $x === $y	                 Returns true if $x and $y have the same key/value pairs in the same order and of the same types	
!=	    Inequality	        $x != $y	                Returns true if $x is not equal to $y	
<>	    Inequality	      $x <> $y	               Returns true if $x is not equal to $y	
!==	     Non-identity	     $x !== $y	             Returns true if $x is not identical to $y	



PHP Conditional Assignment Operators
The PHP conditional assignment operators are used to set a value depending on conditions:

Operator	Name	           Example	                       Result	
?:	     Ternary	       $x = expr1 ? expr2 : expr3	        Returns the value of $x.
                                                   The value of $x is expr2 if expr1 = TRUE.
                                                    The value of $x is expr3 if expr1 = FALSE	


??	  Null coalescing	    $x = expr1 ?? expr2	              Returns the value of $x.
                                                     The value of $x is expr1 if expr1 exists, and is not NULL.
                                                     If expr1 does not exist, or is NULL, the value of $x is expr2.


PHP echo and print Statements
echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.

The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.




define("MESSAGE","Hello World !");
const MESSAGE = "Hello World";
echo MESSAGE;
 echo Constant("MESSAGE");
